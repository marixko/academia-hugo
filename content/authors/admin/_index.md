I hold a Ph.D. in Astronomy from Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas of Universidade de São Paulo. I am member of the [S-PLUS](https://www.splus.iag.usp.br), [J-PAS](https://www.j-pas.org) and [COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/) collaborations. For S-PLUS, I have been involved in the data releases development since 2021 with the S-PLUS DR2. I am leading the search for quasar candidates (including anomalous quasars) and estimation of photometric redshifts for S-PLUS using a variety of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. I am former director (2022) and former vice-director (2023) of Research and Development of Turing USP, a student organization focused on artificial intelligence. I see myself as a problem-solver, I enjoy working with any type of data or astronomical object and I love new challenges.
