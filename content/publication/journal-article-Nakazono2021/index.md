abstract: This paper provides a catalogue of stars, quasars, and galaxies for S-PLUS DR2 in the Stripe 82 region. We show that narrow-band photometry improve the classification performance. Moreover, we show that our classification is robust against missing values. The catalogue with classification and probabilities for Stripe 82 S-PLUS DR2 is available for download.

summary: This paper provides a catalogue of stars, quasars, and galaxies for S-PLUS DR2 in the Stripe 82 region. We show that narrow-band photometry improve the classification performance. Moreover, we show that our classification is robust against missing values. In this paper, one can find a direct link to download the classification and probabilities for Stripe 82 S-PLUS DR. Classification and probabilities for all released S-PLUS fields up to this date are avaialble through https://splus.cloud (the documentation page in this website reports the updated classification performance for S-PLUS DR4).
